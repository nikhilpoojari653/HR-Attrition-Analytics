## 🎯 Objectives
- Identify major factors driving employee attrition  
- Visualize attrition vs non-attrition across departments, roles, age, tenure, and income  
- Provide an interactive tool for HR to perform drill-down analysis using slicers  
- Deliver actionable insights to improve retention strategies

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **Excel** — Data cleaning & preprocessing  
- **Power Query** — Transformations and shaping data  
- **Power BI Desktop** — Interactive visualizations and dashboard design  
- **Charts Used:** KPI cards, bar charts, stacked bars, line charts, matrix, slicers

## 📊 Dashboard Features
- **Top-level KPIs:** Total Employees, Attrition Count, Avg Years at Company, Avg Monthly Income, Avg Training Time  
- **Interactive Visuals:** Department-wise attrition, tenure vs attrition trend, age distribution by attrition, income by department, gender & department breakdown  
- **Slicers:** Department, JobRole, Education, Nationality, Marital Status, Attrition

- Employees with **< 2 years tenure** show increased likelihood of leaving  
- Certain **age bins (25–35)** have the largest share of attrition cases  
- No single gender strongly predicts attrition — distribution varies by department

1. **Data Cleaning (Excel)**
   - Removed duplicates, handled missing values, standardized labels, converted data types.  
2. **Transform & Load (Power BI / Power Query)**
   - Imported cleaned Excel table, ensured proper data types and relationships.  
3. **Modeling & Visuals (Power BI)**
   - Created KPI cards, charts, and slicers. Used basic calculated columns where necessary (no DAX measures).  
4. **Review & Insights**
   - Interpreted visual patterns and documented actionable recommendations for HR.
